# ft_printf
42 ft_printf

this is the code for the ecole 42 project: ft_printf that replicate a part of the printf fonction. 
I made the bonus = the fonction can anlyse:
cspdiuxX%
-0.# +

in practice I mostly use only %s and %d so I made a light version that you can find in the libft.
As it's also one of the exams exercises, the light version can also analyse the %i and %x.
In the light version you also can find a better and simpler way for printing the numbers (%d, %i, %x).
